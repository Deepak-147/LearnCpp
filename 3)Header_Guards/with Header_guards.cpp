Here preprocessor includes contents of math_with_header_guard.h file. In that it checks if A is not defined,
then it defines A and then includes the definition for getSquareSides().
Next preprocessor includes contents of geometry_with_header_guard.h file. In that it checks if B is not defined,
then it defines B and then includes contents of math_with_header_guard.h file. In that it checks if A is not defined, but now it finds that
A is already defined. Thus it skips the contents. And duplicate copies of same function definition are not made.
