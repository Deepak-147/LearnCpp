/*
All of the classes that we have written so far have been simple enough that we have been able to implement the member functions directly inside the class definition itself.
However, as classes get longer and more complicated, having all the member function definitions inside the class can make the class
harder to manage and work with. Using an already-written class only requires understanding its public interface (the public member functions),
not how the class works underneath the hood.

Fortunately, C++ provides a way to separate the "declaration" portion of the class from the "implementation" portion.
This is done by defining the class member functions outside of the class definition. To do so, simply define the member functions
of the class as if they were normal functions, but prefix the class name to the function using the scope resolution operator (::).
