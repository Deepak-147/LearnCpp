/*
A constructor is a special kind of class member function that is automatically called when an object of that class is instantiated.
Constructors are typically used to initialize member variables of the class to appropriate default or user-provided values, or to do any setup steps necessary for the class to be used.

Constructors must have the same name as the class and they do not have any return type(not even void).

Constructors actually serve two purpose:

The primary purpose is to initialize objects that have already been created.
The secondary purpose is to allow creation of an object.

Although the main purpose of a constructor is to initialize an object, whether the constructor actually does an
initialization is up to the programmer. It's perfectly valid to have a constructor that does no
initialization at all (the constructor still serves the purpose of allowing the object to be created,
