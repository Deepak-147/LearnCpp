/*
Inheriting from a base class means we don't have to redefine the information from the base class in our derived classes.
We automatically receive the member functions and member variables of the base class through inheritance, and then simply
add the additional functions or member variables we want. This not only saves work, but also means that if we ever update
or modify the base class (e.g. add new functions, or fix a bug), all of our derived classes will automatically inherit the changes!
