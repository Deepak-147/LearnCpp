/*
Redefining the behavior.
Function overriding is redefinition of base class function in its derived class with same signature i.e return type and parameters.

If we had defined Derived::identify() in the Derived class, it would have been used instead.
So we can make functions work differently with our derived classes by redefining them in the derived class!
