/*
When you create a derived class, it is composed of multiple parts: one part for each inherited class, and a part for itself.
The pointer or reference to the base class calls the base version of the function rather than the derived version.

If only there was some way to make those base pointers call the derived version of a function instead of the base version.......

Because pAnimal is an Animal pointer, it can only see the Animal portion of the class.
Consequently, pAnimal->speak() calls Animal::speak() rather than the Dog::Speak() or Cat::speak() function.
If we want to get the name of the animal and what it speaks, then we can create a report() function for each derived class. This is not good.
We can create one report() function which would let us pass in any class derived from Animal, instead of writing one function per derived class,
we get one function that works with all classes derived from Animal!
