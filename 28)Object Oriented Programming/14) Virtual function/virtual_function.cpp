/*
A virtual function is a special type of function that, when called, resolves to the most-derived version of the function
that exists between the base and derived class. This capability is known as polymorphism. A derived function is considered
a match if it has the same signature (name, parameter types, and whether it is const) and return type as the base version of
the function. Such functions are called overrides.

/*
 Please note that the signature of the derived class function must exactly match the signature of the base class virtual
 function in order for the derived class function to be used.

 If a function is marked as virtual, all matching overrides are also considered virtual, even if they are not explicitly
 marked as such. However, having the keyword virtual on the derived functions does not hurt, and it serves as a useful
 reminder that the function is a virtual function rather than a normal one. Consequently, it's generally a good idea
 to use the virtual keyword for virtualized functions in derived classes even though it's not strictly necessary.

 Never call virtual functions from constructors or destructors.
