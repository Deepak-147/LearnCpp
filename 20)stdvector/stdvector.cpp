/*
Introduced in C++03, std::vector provides dynamic array functionality that handles its own memory management.
This means you can create arrays that have their length set at runtime, without having to explicitly allocate
and deallocate memory using new and delete.
std::vector can be used as a dynamic array that both remembers its length and can be dynamically resized as required.
