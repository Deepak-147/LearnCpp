/*
Function overloading is a feature of C++ that allows us to create multiple functions with the same name,
so long as they have different parameters.
When an overloaded function is called, C++ goes through the following process to determine which
version of the function will be called:
1) First, C++ tries to find an exact match.
2) If no exact match is found, C++ tries to find a match through promotion. Meaning char, short are promoted to int. float is promoted to double. Enum is promoted to int.
3) If no promotion is possible, C++ tries to find a match through standard conversion. Meaning any numeric type will be converted to any numeric type, like int can be converted to float. 0 can be converted to int or a pointer type.
4) Finally, C++ tries to find a match through user-defined conversion.

If a function call matches more than one candidate function. This is an ambiguous match.

    As these values may be converted int or float and it will find two matches for a call. This gives ambiguity.
