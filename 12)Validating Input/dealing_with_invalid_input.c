/*
When the user enters input in response to an extraction operation(>>), that data is placed in a buffer inside of std::cin.

When the extraction operator is used, the following procedure happens:

    1) If there is data already in the input buffer, that data is used for extraction.
    2) If the input buffer contains no data, the user is asked to input data for extraction (this is the case most of the time).
       When the user hits enter, a ‘\n’ character will be placed in the input buffer.
    3) operator >> extracts as much data from the input buffer as it can into the variable (ignoring any leading whitespace characters, such as spaces, tabs, or ‘\n’).
    4) Any data that can not be extracted is left in the input buffer for the next extraction.

    Example: when user inputs '5*7', when asked to enter a operand value.

    One more problem can occur when the extraction succeeds and there is no extraneous input. But the input is of not proper type.
    When the user enters ‘a’, that character is placed in the buffer.
    Then operator >> tries to extract ‘a’ to variable x, which is of type double. Since ‘a’ can’t be converted to a double, operator >> can’t do the extraction.
    Two things happen at this point: ‘a’ is left in the buffer, and std::cin goes into “failure mode”. Once in ‘failure mode’, future requests for input extraction will silently fail.
