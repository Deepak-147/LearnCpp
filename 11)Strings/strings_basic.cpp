/*
Because strings are commonly used in programs, most modern languages include a built-in string data type.
C++ includes one, not as part of the core language, but as part of the standard library.

To use strings in C++, we first need to #include the <string> header to bring in the declarations for std::string.
Once that is done, we can define variables of type std::string.
